# End-to-End-Banking-Risk-Data-Analytics-Project

🏦 Banking Risk Analysis Project Report
📌 Problem Statement:

Risk analysis in banking and financial services to understand how data can minimize the risk of losing money while lending loans to customers.

🎯 Project Objective:

To analyze customer and financial data to identify high-risk individuals and understand patterns that lead to loan defaults. The goal is to enable data-driven decisions that reduce financial risk and improve loan approval strategies.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:

Excel – Data cleaning and basic exploration
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data preprocessing and visualization
SQL – Data querying and filtering
Power BI – Dashboard and interactive visualizations

🧠 Methodology:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Removed duplicates and null values and Standardized data formats (dates, currency, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed customer age, income, credit card usage, deposits, loan amount, etc. Visualized relationships using heatmaps, bar charts, and histograms.
Segmentation & Risk Profiling: Grouped customers based on attributes: income, credit card balance, occupation, etc. Identified high-risk groups (e.g., low-income + high credit usage).
Risk Scoring & Weighting: Assigned risk weights based on financial behavior, Built a risk matrix to classify customers into Low, Medium, High risk
Dashboard Creation: Created interactive Power BI dashboards to showcase insights, Included filters for demographics, income level, product usage, and risk classification

🔍 Key Insights & Findings:

Customers with low income and high credit card balances had a higher risk of default
Lack of savings or deposit history correlated strongly with increased risk
Occupation and age groups showed clear patterns — e.g., younger, entry-level employees posed higher risk
Customers owning multiple financial products (checking, savings, credit card) showed lower default risk
Loyalty classification and past banking history helped refine risk prediction

✅ Proposed Solution:

To minimize risk in lending decisions, the bank should:

Implement a risk scoring model that weighs customer attributes like income, savings, credit usage, and occupation
Use data-driven dashboards for real-time customer risk monitoring
Automate flagging of high-risk profiles during loan application
Encourage use of multiple banking products to promote financial discipline
Offer targeted financial education or lower-risk products to high-risk customers
